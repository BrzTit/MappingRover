# TODO

1. Implement Bluetooth connection
    BLE necessary? Is BLE enough?

2. Send control commands
    First, fwd, backwd, left turn and right turn
    Later, both tracks controllable through analog joysticks?

3. Send/receive sensor commands
    Format:
        Position, direction, (distance,direction)*\n
